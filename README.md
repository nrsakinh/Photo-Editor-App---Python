# Photo-Editor-App---Python
An interactive painting editor application, 

Users can load single or multiple images into the editor, edit them and save the results back to their working directory. The application also allows the creation of new blank image canvases, which can be customized to specific dimensions, allowing users to start projects from scratch. Core functionalities include geometric image transformations such as scaling, translation and rotation, enabling precise adjustments to image orientation and size. The cropping tool, activated via mouse or manual input, further enhances this precision. Color manipulation is a standout feature, allowing conversions between color spaces such as RGB, HSV, grayscale and others. Additionally, the editor supports pixel-level operations, allowing users to select and alter the colors of specific pixels or groups of pixels. For creative enhancements, tools for drawing basic primitives like circles, lines and text on the canvas are readily available.
